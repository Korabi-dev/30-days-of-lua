# Day 1 | How does Lua work?

## Interpreted or Compiled?

Lua can be either or based on the use case. If Lua is being interpreted it means that the script is interpreted and executed line by line. If it is being compiled that means the Lua Compiler turns the script into Bytecode which is then executed by a Virtual Machine which interprets and executes the instructions from the Bytecode

## Data Types

Lua supports basic data types, those types being: Strings, Numbers, Booleans (or bools), and Tables. You will need these to store information, like names, ages, weather someone is an admin, and a lists of people!

## Memory Management

Lua has something called a "garbage collector", this means that you won't have to worry about manually managing the memory your script uses, it's all done for you.

## Not sure what all of this means?

That's all good! This is just some stuff to get you started, we'll dive deeper into these topics later in the course!
