# Day 1 | How does Lua work?

## Interpreted or Compiled?
Lua is an interpreted language, this means that the code does not need to be compiled before it is ran, the code is read and interpreted line by line before it is ran.

## Data Types
Lua supports basic data types, those types being: Strings, Numbers, Booleans (or bools), and Tables. You will need these to store information, like names, ages, weather someone is an admin, and a lists of people!

---
## Memory Management
Lua has something called a "garbage collector", this means that you won't have to worry about manually managing the memory your script uses, its all done for you.

## Not sure what all of this means?
That's all good! This is just some stuff to get you started, we'll dive in deeper into these topics later in the course!
