Hey there üëã

Welcome to my GitHub. This repository is for absolute beginners who'd like to start coding with Lua!

## What is Lua ‚ùì

Lua is a simple, fast, lightweight, and versatile programming language often used for web-related apps and making games. A popular example of Lua inside of a game is Roblox as it uses a modified Lua 5.1. It was initially started for extending applications. It has a clean syntax which is designed to be easy to learn, This syntax is very similar to the syntax in Python. Lua can be integrated with other programming languages such as C. 

## Why learn Lua ‚ùì

Lua is a very easy-to-learn programming language used in various websites, games, and more.  

## What should I expect ‚ùì

This is meant to be an excellent starting place to learn Lua and get into programming if you haven't already. I will try my hardest to not only teach Lua but also explain it in depth, explain general programming concepts, incorporate real-world examples, and some fun challenges along the way.



## Reminder ‚ö†Ô∏è

While I am quite experienced in Lua I'm still not the best at it, However, I will be trying my best and somethings will be skipped over and left out because I don't remember it. I will be mainly focusing on Luau (https://github.com/Roblox/luau) also known as "Roblox Lua", most of the key concepts still apply to standard Lua. This course assumes you have a method to execute Lua Scripts. This can be done via Roblox Studio or an online source.
