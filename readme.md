Hey there üëã

Welcome to my github. This repository is for absolute beginners who'd like to start coding with Lua!

## What is Lua ‚ùì

Lua is a simple, fast, and versatile scripting language often used for extending and customizing applications or games. It has a clean syntax and is designed to be easy to learn and integrate with other programming languages.

## Why learn Lua ‚ùì

Lua is a simple, powerful, and fast language. It's based on the C programming language, but still easy to learn!

## What should I expect ‚ùì

This is meant to be a good place to come and get into programming if you're not already a programmer, I'll try my best to not only teach the Lua language but also explain general programming concepts, incorporate real world examples, and also some fun challeneges along the way.



## Reminder ‚ö†Ô∏è

While I have been using Lua for quite some time and I am quite experienced with it, I'm still not perfect, information might be left out simply because I didn't remember it, or check. Now I think it's also important to note that I'll be mostly focusing on "Roblox Lua" here, however this should also apply to vanilla lua. This course assumes you have a way to actually run lua scripts (such as a roblox game, or an online source)
